Social Network Application - Django Project Brief

Purpose of the Application:
The purpose of the social network application is to provide a platform for users to connect, share, and interact with each other. It aims to facilitate communication, collaboration, and engagement among users with common interests or connections. The application should be user-friendly, visually appealing, and foster a sense of community.

Base Level Functionality:
1. User Registration and Authentication:
   - Users should be able to create an account by providing basic information like name, email, and password.
   - Once registered, users should be able to log in using their credentials.
   - Password reset functionality should be available in case users forget their password.

2. User Profile:
   - Each user should have a profile page where they can provide additional information such as a profile picture, bio, and contact information.
   - Users should be able to edit and update their profile information.

3. News Feed:
   - The application should provide a news feed where users can view posts from their connections or groups they have joined.
   - The news feed should display posts in a chronological order, with options to like, comment, and share posts.
   - Users should be able to filter their news feed based on specific criteria such as friends, groups, or particular interests.

4. Friends and Connections:
   - Users should be able to send friend requests to other users and accept or decline friend requests.
   - The application should provide a list of a user's connections/friends, with options to view their profiles and send messages.

5. Groups and Communities:
   - Users should have the ability to create and join groups based on their interests.
   - Group members should be able to share posts, comment, and interact within the group.
   - Group admins should have additional privileges such as managing group settings, inviting members, and moderating posts.

6. Messaging:
   - The application should include a messaging system where users can send private messages to their connections.
   - Users should be able to view their message history and receive notifications for new messages.

Database Design:
The database design should reflect the various entities and relationships within the application. Some key entities include:

1. User:
   - Fields: id (primary key), name, email, password, profile picture, bio, contact information.

2. Posts:
   - Fields: id (primary key), user (foreign key to User), content, timestamp.

3. Friend Requests:
   - Fields: id (primary key), sender (foreign key to User), receiver (foreign key to User), status (accept/decline).

4. Groups:
   - Fields: id (primary key), name, description, creator (foreign key to User), timestamp.

5. Group Memberships:
   - Fields: id (primary key), user (foreign key to User), group (foreign key to Group).

6. Messages:
   - Fields: id (primary key), sender (foreign key to User), receiver (foreign key to User), content, timestamp.

These are the initial functionalities and database design for the social network application. Depending on the project's scope, additional features like notifications, search functionality, and privacy settings can be incorporated to enhance the user experience.
